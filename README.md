Express Portfolio Site							
Overview: Create your Personal Portfolio Website using ExpressJS and implementing the PUG templating engine.


Instructions:
This Express site must include the pages from your Personal Portfolio 5 pages – your Home page, an About Me page, a Projects page, a Services page, and a Contact Me page.

1.	Your Portfolio site will use ExpressJS and NodeJS and your web pages have been split to use different View templates and partials by implementing the PUG templating engine and Express Routes (4 Marks: GUI, 4 Marks: Functionality):
a.	You need minimum 1 view template (4 Marks: Functionality, 4 Marks: GUI).
b.	An Express Route must exist for each page of your site. Note: You will need to use the app.get(path, callback(req, res, next)) method structure with a res.render(view, locals) method call to render each view (4 Marks: Functionality).
2.	Your site will use the new structure created by the Express Generator. Your site files will be migrated to work within the public, routes and views folders (20 Marks: Site Structure):
a.	Generate your site structure with the Express Generator. Note: You must use the -e option to ensure that you implement the PUG templating engine for Express (3 Marks: Site Structure).
b.	Your JavaScript, CSS and Multimedia Asset Files should be moved to separate folders within the public folder. Using the Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework or a 3rd party theme (must reference the source) is strongly recommended.
